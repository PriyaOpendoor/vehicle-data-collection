# Data for "Who Is Collecting Data from Your Car?"

This contains the data for our story "[Who Is Collecting Data from Your Car?](https://themarkup.org/the-breakdown/2022/07/27/who-is-collecting-data-from-your-car)".

The Markup has identified 37 companies that are part of the rapidly growing connected vehicle data industry that seeks to monetize such data in an environment with few regulations governing its sale or use.

# Methodology

We assigned categories to the companies in this list after reviewing their websites, marketing materials, industry research reports and speaking with industry experts. 

### Categories

- **Vehicle data hubs** ingest vehicle and movement data from multiple sources: from car manufacturers, other connected vehicle data providers, directly from vehicles using aftermarket hardware such as “onboard diagnostics” (OBD) dongles, or from smartphone apps. The data is then consolidated and normalized in one place for analysis and insights.

- **Navigation and in-vehicle infotainment companies** provide dashboards with driving directions, music, and third-party apps. 

- **Insurance companies** create “usage-based” insurance and other products that offer discounts, or premium increases, based on actual driving data.

- **Telecom operators** offer car manufacturers connectivity solutions both integrated into the vehicle or in the form of a dongle that plugs into the car’s OBD port, acting as a WiFi hotspot while also tapping into the car’s telematic data.

- **Telematics providers** make aftermarket tracking hardware and software that collect data directly from cars. They cater to commercial fleet operators and also to OEMs.
